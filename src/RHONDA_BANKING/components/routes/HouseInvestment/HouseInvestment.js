                <p>Choices for this price point include a cash-out refinance, a  or a home equity line of credit (HELOC).
                     A cash-out refinance gives you access to cash as you refinance. 
                    A home equity loan offers a single lump sum at a fixed rate. And a HELOC provides convenience at a low cost.

                        A home equity loan provides fixed rates and a steady repayment schedule.

                    <p>A cash-out refinance is a great way to get new mortgage terms and borrow funds for one-time expenses at the same time.
                         Some benefits may include access to cash at closing,
                         a better rate and the ability to consolidate debt into a single monthly payment.</p>

                    <p>A home improvement personal loan or home equity loan are good ideas if you’re looking for a lump sum of money 
                        to get your project started. For more flexibility with ongoing access to funds, consider a home improvement personal line of credit,
                         home equity line of credit or the Supreme Trust Bank Visa® Platinum Credit Card.</p>
